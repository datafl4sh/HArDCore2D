This framework contains the tools required to build and load 3-\/dimensional generic meshes for use in scientific computing applications. It also contains abstractions for dealing with polynomial basis functions and integration on the cells and faces of the mesh. This guide is composed of four parts\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{#mesh}{\tt The mesh} -- How to load data from mesh files and how to interpret the structure of the mesh
\item \href{#integration}{\tt Integration and the Hybrid\+Core structure} -- How to use the \hyperlink{classMeshFramework2D_1_1HybridCore}{Hybrid\+Core} structure to compute integrals on the cells and faces of the mesh, and how to use the polynomial basis functions
\item \href{#hmm}{\tt Example -\/ The Hybrid Mimetic Mixed (H\+MM) scheme} -- An example implementation of the H\+MM scheme that illustrates the use of the mesh data and the integration routines
\item \href{#build}{\tt Build instructions} -- How to build the example schemes and the documentation files
